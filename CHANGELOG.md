# Changelog

Notable changes to **breakdown** (published on PyPI as `metric-breakdown`).

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

**Pre-1.0 contract.** While the major version is `0`, the public API is the CLI,
the tree YAML schema, and the HTTP/MCP surface — and breaking changes to any of
them land in a **minor** bump (`0.1 → 0.2`), with patch releases reserved for
fixes. Callers who need stability should pin `metric-breakdown~=0.1.0` until 1.0.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`breakdown --version`** and **`breakdown.__version__`**, both read from the
  installed distribution metadata so `pyproject.toml` stays the only place a
  version is written and the two can never disagree.
- **CI matrix over Python 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13** with every provider extra
  installed, plus a **3.14 job that installs the wheel with no extras** and runs
  the same suite — so `requires-python = ">=3.11"` is tested at both ends
  instead of advertised.

### Changed

- **Provider SDKs are now extras.** `pip install metric-breakdown` installs the
  engine, API, UI, MCP server and the `mock` provider — 70 packages / ~390 MB,
  down from 138 / ~640 MB. Real providers opt in:
  `metric-breakdown[dbt]` for `local` and `cloud`, `metric-breakdown[databricks]`
  for `warehouse`, `metric-breakdown[all]` for both. Selecting a provider whose
  extra is absent raises `MissingProviderExtra` naming the exact `pip install`,
  and `breakdown doctor` reports it as its own check with the downstream
  connectivity checks skipped rather than failing misleadingly.
- **The base package supports Python 3.14.** It could not before, because
  dbt-core was a hard dependency and its `mf` binary does not run there. The
  `dbt` extra is still 3.13-and-earlier.
- **Dependency floors lowered** to versions the suite is actually verified
  against (`numpy>=1.26`, `pandas>=2.1`, `pymc>=5.16`, `pydantic>=2.7`,
  `fastapi>=0.115`, `networkx>=3.1`, `uvicorn>=0.27`, `arviz>=0.22`), so
  breakdown stops forcing a resolver conflict on stacks that are a few months
  behind. `mcp>=2.0` is unchanged — the server genuinely uses 2.x APIs.

## [0.1.0] — unreleased

First public release.

### Added

- **Engine.** Per-node Bayesian Structural Time Series with contemporaneous and
  lagged regressors and business-unit priors. Root-cause analysis over the
  ancestor DAG combining exact per-day Shapley attribution on `formula` nodes
  with posterior attribution on probabilistic ones, block-bootstrap credible
  intervals, an explicit `unexplained` term, and convergence diagnostics on
  every fit.
- **Per-node grains** (`grain`, `kind`) so ratio and cohort metrics are fitted at
  the grain they are meaningful at, with cohort-aligned lagged identities.
- **Dimensional slicing** — attribute a node's gap across a declared dimension,
  ranked by excess concentration, with a UI panel, MCP tool and API endpoint.
- **What-if simulation** — do-operator interventions, assumption links, Shapley
  source attribution, and a **cold-start mode** (`provider: none`) that runs the
  whole what-if machine on declared beliefs with no data at all.
- **Providers** — `mock`, `local` (MetricFlow), `cloud` (dbt Cloud Semantic
  Layer), `warehouse` (direct SQL), plus a parquet snapshot cache so a tree
  refits without touching the warehouse.
- **UI** at `/ui` — Cytoscape DAG, per-metric series and posteriors,
  point-and-click RCA, what-if builder, exportable HTML report, deep links.
- **MCP server** at `/mcp` for AI assistants, with interpretation caveats and
  deep links back into the UI. Optional bearer-token gate via
  `BREAKDOWN_API_TOKEN`.
- **`breakdown doctor`** — walks a provider's auth chain and prints copy-paste
  remediation for each failure.
